# PyXPAT
Python: X-ray PDB Analysis Tool

From a sequence alignment
- extract and download pdb files
- extract and identify if the selection sites have a gap/deletion
- mark the residues for analysis
- extract distances and other interesting properties
- extract distances and other interesting properties
- run statistical analysis and generate a report

Works only for Triosephosphate isomerase. Tool needs to be generalized.



#### **Requirements**:
- Python2.6+, numpy 1.15,scipy
- NOT COMPATIBLE WITH Python3

#### **Issues**:
- **Hard coded residues**
- **Coded for TIM**
